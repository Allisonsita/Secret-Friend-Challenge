# 🎁 Secret Santa Web App

This project implements a simple web application for organizing a **"Secret Santa" game**. It allows users to add names to a list and then randomly select one.

## 🔹 Main Features

### 1️⃣ Adding Friends to the List  
- The user enters a name in a text field and clicks the **"Add"** button.

- If the name is valid, it's added to an array and displayed on the screen.  

### 2️⃣ Drawing a Secret Friend  
- When the user clicks the **"Draw Friend"** button, a random name is selected from the list.  
- If the list is empty, a warning message is displayed.  
- The selected name is shown on the screen.  

### 3️⃣ User Interactivity
